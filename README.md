E-sign

Overview:

Many loan departments need to determine who will sign for a loan or even who may go into default. Whether that is to market themselves to gain new customers or see which customers may go into default. Loan departments would like to understand what factors best influence their issue at hand. This particular situation, the loan comapany would like to understand the different factors that contribute to which customers will sign or not sign for a loan.

This notebook contains an in depth explanation of the results behind the analysis and reasoning behind the strategies I use within each project.

This is a classification problem where we use different features to predict the likelihood of a customer signing for a loan.
We look at the relationships between the features and targets.
Examine data with different visualizations using seaborn.
We will use models such as random forest, ensemble methods and SVM.
